#### General Idea
* User adds Abracadaniel to their Wunderlist user list
* User assigns a task to Abracadaniel, which sends an email to a specially formatted email address that encodes the info that it needs.
* Abracadaniel then sends a text to Magic, using an internal-use SMS code so that it can capture the response.
* The response is posted to a Slack channel or some other chat service so that the user can interact with the Magic representative in real time.
* The user is sent a notification pointing them to the slack/chat channel
* The channel has bots that handle things like checking calendar automatically, verifying funds for purchase, etc.
* Instead of using a stateful chat, maybe just use a group SMS?
